				Doing activities with a buddy is  not only fun and exciting, it has
				  some really great benefits too.  We'll bore you with a few. You're more likely to:
			</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Stick to your commitments</li>
			<li> Build new friendships</li>
			<li> Boost motivation</li>
			<li> Improve your mental and physical well-being</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We created BuddyUp so people can do activities and go to events with others who have similar interests but don't want to go alone.
			   Sign up to select an activity and match with a buddy of your choice.</p>
